        I grew up in Manila, Philippines with a Filipino and Chinese family. We moved to New Zealand when I 
        was 16 where I finished high school. I pursued a degree in Commerce and IT at the University of Queensland 
        where I worked with Mark on a university project. Even though I completed most of the components of that 
        project, we became very close friends and became inseparable ever since.

        I am now working as a Senior Analyst in Deloitte, and keep myself busy by learning how to play the saxophone, 
        playing video games and riding my bike.
