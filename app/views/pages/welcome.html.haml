        I grew up in Manila, Philippines with a Filipino and Chinese family. While I was named after the Filipino singer, 
        Regine Velasquez, I was not gifted with a talent to sing! I spent most of my time in school in O.B. Montessori Centre 
        Inc. I was a bit of a “tomboy” growing up, who enjoyed guns and cars and didn’t really enjoy playing with Barbie Dolls.

        My family and I moved to Auckland, New Zealand when I was 16 where I finished Year 12 and Year 13. I pursued a degree 
        in Commerce and IT at the University of Queensland where I met Mark. I am now working as a Senior Analyst in Deloitte, 
        and keep myself busy by learning how to play the saxophone, playing video games and riding my bike.

        Since meeting Mark, I have been more active and tried things that I would never imagine taking part in - hiking, knee 
        boarding, sailing a catamaran in the Fijian Islands, and (most importantly) Mark has supported my growth as a Christian 
        as well as believing in my strengths to achieve my goals.

        I was born in Maryborough (1990-09-19) and spent the first eight years of my life growing up on a hobby farm on the 
        outskirts of the town. My mother forwent her teaching job to raise me, while my father worked as a pharmacist. At 
        age 8 we moved to Bundaberg. While in Bundaberg I attended several different schools - primarily Bundaberg Christian 
        College and St Luke’s Anglican School. I was always a relatively high-achieving student, with a passion for mathematics 
        and all things computers.

        My first true job was stacking shelves and selling lawn mowers at Bunnings which gave me a real appreciation for the 
        average Australian. I completed my schooling, graduating with an OP 1 and travelled to the University of Queensland, 
        starting a dual degree in Information Technology and Mathematics in 2008.

        Since meeting Regine, I have learned to be more empathetic and understanding of others. Most importantly though, Regine 
        has been the most stable and loving friend I could have ever wished for. Throughout good times and bad, she’s been there 
        for me, looking after me and ensuring that I stay safe, healthy (somewhat) and sane.

        We met in July 2009 during our second year of university through common friends for a group assignment. We became very 
        close friends and study mates, sharing the same interests in music and TV shows (Stargate!) to name a few. Three months
        (and many late nights working on assignments) later, we became a couple.

        We dated for a total of four years. To celebrate our four year anniversay and Regine's 24th birthday we travelled to Fiji
        for a romantic getaway. While staying in Fiji, Mark proposed with a gorgeous Sapphire and diamond platinum ring over a 
        three-course room service dinner and bottle of French champagne. Regine said yes and we enjoyed the rest of our holiday 
        without telling anyone about the engagement (we wanted peace before the storm of social interaction as it were).
